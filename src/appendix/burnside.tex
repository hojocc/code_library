The Burnside's lemma says that
$$ |X / G| = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} |X^g| $$
where $G$ is a group acting on $X$, $X^g$ is the set of elements in $X$ that are fixed by $g$, i.e. $X^g = \{x \in X : gx = x\}$.

The unweighted version of P\'olya enumeration theorem says that
$$ |Y^X / G| = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} m^{c_g} $$
where $m = |X|$ is the number of colors, $c_g$ is the number of the cycles of permutation $g$.
